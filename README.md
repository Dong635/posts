A repository of code that I have mentioned or used on my blog: http://hpaulkeeler.com/posts/

Feel free to use any of the code for whatever purposes. If you publish a paper using any of the code, please cite this repository. 

I have written the code mostly in MATLAB, R and Python. Most of it concerns simulating point processes, which are also called random point fields or random counting measures.

Examples include simulating a homogeneous Poisson point process on a disk and triangle. 

See the individual posts for more details. The repository directories and the corresponding posts.
