A repository of code that has appeared on my blog: http://hpaulkeeler.com/posts/

I have written the code mostly in MATLAB, R and Python. Most of it concerns simulating point processes, which are also called random point fields or random counting measures.

Examples include simulating a homogeneous Poisson point process on a disk and triangle. 

See the individual posts for more details.
