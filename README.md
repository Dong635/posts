A repository of code that has appeared on my blog: http://hpaulkeeler.com/posts/

The code is mostly in MATLAB, R and Python. Most of it concerns simulating point processes (or random point fields).

Examples including simulating a homogeneous Poisson point process on a disk and triangle. 

See the individual posts for more details.
